Add RUN button that would send the object to php to render on the preview
SAVE FILE have to run the renderData from jsonDataContr


PHP

?

When the json data is received save it to the database
When showing the data saved in the site take it from the database
When adding another data just append it ? - makes no sense if php is already taking the data from db 

What if RUN mode is just to test the output?
And I make SAVE mode actually save it to the database where the actual data would be stored o_0?


JS

First fix the image link though
Add a way to make so the parent is editable and you can add the class so change the design + CSS
